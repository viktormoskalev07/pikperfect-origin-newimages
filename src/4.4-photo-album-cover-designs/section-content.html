If there are multiple photos from a similar setting, we choose the ones that have the best quality, are well composed, have good facial expressions, and which would give us the most options while designing the albums. For example, if there is an image that is tightly cropped but another similar image with more space around it, we’ll choose the latter as it allows us to then more easily resize or zoom, if needed, during the design phase.',
