                <p>A <a href="https://www.pikperfect.com/photo-books" target="_blank" class="link">photo book</a> is digitally printed on flexible pages and is glue bound like a traditional book. Photo book pages do not lay flat when open: there is a gutter between the two pages on a spread, so if a photo crosses over two pages you can lose a bit in the gutter. Photo books are sturdy, can accommodate up to 240 pages and make for the ideal coffee table photo book.</p>

                <p>Our Layflat Photo Albums are developed on silver halide photo paper, which offers the colors and brilliance of a genuine photo print. These albums are bound using a special technique that allows the pages to lay flat when open. These pages are much thicker and stiffer than a photo book, but not as thick or rigid as a premium layflat album. The uninterrupted spreads make <a href="https://www.pikperfect.com/photo-books/layflat-photo-albums" target="_blank" class="link">lay flat photo albums</a> ideal for weddings or other special occasions.</p>
