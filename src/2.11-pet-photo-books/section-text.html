      <p>It’s now easier than ever to create a pet memorial photo album for your furriest family member. Start off by choosing your favorite photos but also choose images that highlight some of the most memorable moments, like the time you caught them doing something naughty, or the loving look of support they offer when you’re having a bad day. Don’t forget to include photos of the everyday, as well their interactions with other family members or friends.</p>
      <p>Don’t hesitate to add your thoughts or favorite quotes about your pet, just send us the text you would like to include and we’ll make sure to design these into your big pet photo album. You may also want to include photos of paw prints, your kid’s drawing of the pet, or any other memento that would be meaningful in a printed photo book.</p>
