            <p class="section-content__text-bottom">We offer a range of different paper types and finishes, to meet all of your photo book printing needs. Our layflat albums are all developed on Silver halide papers which offer very accurate skin tones, greater depth, and an increased color range and vibrancy. Our photo books are produced on HP Indigo Digital Presses, and while these offer incredible detail and color range for digital print, they will not have the same detail or depth as a Silver halide photo print. The advantage of digitally printed papers is that they are much less sensitive to moisture.</p>

The velvet surface appeals to the sense of touch and offers the ultimate, deep-matte experience. Please note, the colors will not be as intense as the Fuji Pearl Matte or Gloss papers.',

This is an excellent paper for everyday photo book printing.
