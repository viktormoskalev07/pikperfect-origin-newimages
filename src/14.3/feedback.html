                <p class="feedback__description">We’ll start working on the album design and email you a first draft in the next 2- 4 business days.</p>
                <p>If you do not see an email by then, please check your SPAM folder as they occasionally get caught there. Once the design is approved and the album sent to print, production + shipping typically takes about 12 days express and 16 days via standard mail.</p>
                <p>If you need your album urgently, please let us know when you need this delivered and we’ll do all we can to expedite this for you.</p>
