    <div class="section-text__content">        
      <p>By partnering with Pikperfect, you will be set up to sell custom designed wedding albums and <a href="https://www.pikperfect.com/photo-books" class="link" target="_blank">photo books</a> without the need to stare at your screen for hours on end. Image editing is enough work on its own! The best part is that you remain in complete creative control of your style and design preferences, while also allowing your clients the opportunity to review the albums and add their feedback on an unbranded album review link.</p>
      <p>Quality <a href="https://www.pikperfect.com/wedding-albums/premium-layflat-wedding-albums" class="link" target="_blank">leather wedding albums</a> for photographers are pretty expensive to produce, never mind sell to a client as a profitable product. Many couples are not willing or able to make the investment, and end up opting for a cheaper photo book, or even ditching the idea of an album altogether. At PikPerfect we offer the perfect compromise in our layflat albums that are hand-crafted using only the very best materials to produce heirloom quality albums that your clients will cherish for life.</p>
